<p align="center">
    <strong>An arena allocation library for trivial types.</strong>
</p>

_Currently a work-in-progress, still needs thorough testing before any_
_production use. This work is intended for use in a corner-stiching_
_implementation, however it is being devoloped separately due to it likely_
_highly reusable._

The library is named after the Roman goddess of memory Monēta (mo'ne.ta).
